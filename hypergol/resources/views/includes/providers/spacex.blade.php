        Building on the achievements of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, SpaceX is working on a
        next generation of fully reusable launch vehicles that will
        be the most powerful ever built,
        capable of carrying humans to Mars and other destinations in the solar system.

    <h3 class="mt-3 font-semibold text-lg">Reusability</h3>
    <p class="mt-1 text-gray-900 sm:mt-0">
        SpaceX believes a fully and rapidly reusable rocket is the pivotal breakthrough needed to substantially reduce the cost of space access.
        The majority of the launch cost comes from building the rocket, which historically has flown only once.
